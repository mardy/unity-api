Build dependencies
------------------

List of packages required to build and test the code:

- cmake (cmake, 2.8.10 with patch (see below) or later)
- gcovr (gcovr, 2.4-0ubuntu1 or later)
- lcov (lcov, 1.9-3 with patch (see below) or later)
- gtest (libgtest-dev, 1.6.0 or later)
- cppcheck (cppcheck, 1.55-1 or later)
- doxygen (doxygen, 1.8.1.2-1 or later)
- graphviz (graphviz, 2.26.3-12ubuntu1 or later)
- libboost (libboost1.49-dev or later)
- libboost-thread (libbost-thread1.49-dev or later)
- libboost-regex-dev (libbost-regex1.49-dev or later)


Building the code
-----------------

The simplest case is:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..

By default, the code is built in release mode. To build a debug version, use

    $ mkdir builddebug
    $ cd builddebug
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug ..
    $ make

For a release version, use -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release

To build with the flags for coverage testing enabled:

    $ mkdir buildcoverage
    $ cd makecoverage
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=coverage
    $ make


Running the tests
-----------------

    $ make
    $ make test

Note that "make test" alone is dangerous because it does not rebuild
any tests if either the library or the test files themselves need
rebuilding. It's not possible to fix this with cmake because cmake cannot
add build dependencies to built-in targets. To make sure that everything
is up-to-date, run "make" before running "make test"!

To run the tests with valgrind:

    $ make valgrind

To get coverage output:

    $ make test
    $ make coverage-html

(The coverage-html target is available only if the code was built with -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=coverage.)


Note that, with gcc 4.7.2 and cmake 2.8.10, you may get a bunch of
warnings. To fix this, you can build cmake 2.8.10 with the following patch:

http://cmake.org/gitweb?p=cmake.git;a=commitdiff;h=61ace1df2616e472d056b302e4269cbf112fb020#patch1

Unfortunately, it is not possibly to get 100% coverage for some files,
mainly due to gcc's generation of two destructors for dynamic and non-
dynamic instances. For abstract base classes and for classes that
prevent stack and static allocation, this causes one of the destructors
to be reported as uncovered.

There are also issues with some functions in header files that are
incorrectly reported as uncovered due to inlining, as well as
the impossibility of covering defensive assert(false) statements,
such as an assert in the default branch of a switch, where the
switch is meant to handle all possible cases explicitly.

If you run a binary and get lots of warnings about a "merge mismatch for summaries",
this is caused by having made changes to the source that add or remove code
that was previously run, so the new coverage output cannot sensibly be merged
into the old coverage output. You can get rid of this problem by running

    $ make clean-coverage

This deletes all the .gcda files, allowing the merge to succeed again.

If lcov complains about unrecognized lines, apply this patch
to /usr/bin/geninfo:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=590034

To run the static C++ checks:

    $ make cppcheck


Installation
------------

To get files that form part of an installation, run a "make install"
in the build directory. By default, this installs them in the "install"
subdirectory of the build directory. If you want to install into a
different directory, use

$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local # Or wherever...
$ make release
$ make install
